What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git hidden folder is created in your directory.  You have to initialize a repository before you can make the first commit - it's a setup step.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as an in-between for the working directory and the repository.  Before files are added to the repository they are moved to the staging area.

The staging area seems useful for helping you to organize the next commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area will show you which files have changed.  Running git diff --staged will show you which code changes will be committed.  This information should help you determine if your staged commit is one logical change.
